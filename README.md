# Sprig MicroPython Firmware

This isn't being made as any sort of replacement or anything, just a fun project. The goal is to have a platform similar to the original with the same amount ofhackability, but with MicroPython. This has the added bonus of being able to draw stuff directly.

## TODO:
- [x] Create basic setup with settings and launcher
- [ ] Add audio support
- [ ] Add network support
- [ ] Graphics helpers
    - [ ] Tilemap
    - [ ] Custom MicroPython firmware with native draw functions and display driver

## Apps I Want to Make:
- [ ] Software gallery (when) if networking is added
- [ ] Chat App
- [ ] Games
    - [ ] Flappy Bird clone
    - [ ] Chip-8 Emulator
